⚠️ **Important**: The JavaScript-generated files in this directory are minimal placeholders.

## For Real Testing

Please replace these files with actual Office documents:

### Option 1: Create Your Own
1. Open Microsoft Word/Excel/PowerPoint (or compatible software)
2. Create a simple document with some content
3. Save as:
   - \`sample.docx\` (Word)
   - \`sample.xlsx\` (Excel)
   - \`sample.pptx\` (PowerPoint)
4. Copy the files to this directory

### Option 2: Use the File Upload
Instead of using sample file buttons:
- Use the "Upload your Office document" input on the example page
- Select your own .docx, .xlsx, or .pptx file
- The viewer will display it immediately

## Why Placeholders Don't Work

Office files (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) are actually ZIP archives containing XML files
and media. They cannot be created correctly with simple JavaScript in Node.js
without specialized libraries.

The viewer requires real Office documents to function properly.

console.log('\nPlease read the instructions above and add real Office documents.');
